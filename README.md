# CONNEQT

[ConneQt][heroku]

[heroku]: https://conneqt.herokuapp.com/

ConneQt is an mobile application that is designed to improve the process of exchanging contact information. We created ConneQt to aid individuals in networking. The process is simple. To get ConneQted, simply scan another user's QR code.

We are living in the digital era where more and more social networking platforms are on the rise. It is already becoming a hassle to add or(find) the same person via LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Skype, etc. Although this app is still under development, we hope ConneQt can improve peopleâ€™s lives by helping them borden their horizons through an mobile app that makes making new acquaintances easier.

Our Mobile Application utilizes the MERN web stack. These frameworks stand for MongoDB, Express, React-Native, Node.js

Our mobile app's profile page is for personal use. Each user's profile page will contain a myriad of social networking platforms for the user to input their contact information into.

At each networking option, there will be a toggle to filter what others can see.
