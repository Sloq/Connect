# CONNEQT

ConneQt is an mobile application that is designed to improve the process of exchanging contact and social network information.  We created ConneQt to aid individuals in networking. The process is simple. To get ConneQted, simply scan another user's QR code. We are living in the digital era where more and more social networking platforms are on the rise. It is already becoming a hassle to add or(find) the same person via LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Skype, etc. Although this app is still under development, we deeply hope CONNEQT can improve peopleâ€™s lives by helping them borden their horizons through an mobile app that makes making new acquaintances easier.
